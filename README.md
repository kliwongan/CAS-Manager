# CAS-Manager
Native Android application designed to keep track of CAS activities, time spent on activities and reflections with the capability of easy export when the procrastinating IB student must inevitably fill out their CAS portfolio that they've been letting off since three years ago.

Made for my Computer Science IB HL Interal Assessment (Grade 12)
